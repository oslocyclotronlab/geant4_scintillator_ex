#geant4_scintillator_ex
Basic example of a scintillator (optical physics class) implementation in geant4

It's based on the geant4 tutorial by E. Nacher given on the SWG spring school 2015

 1 - GEOMETRY DEFINITION
 
     The setup consists of a small LaBr3 cylinder surrounded by MgO reflector, and optically coupled to a Bialkali Photocathode through a Quartz PMT Window. 

More information can also be found in the README-Questions. Please be aware, that some of this might be **outdated**!, as for example the way that the histograms are created. In the latest version, just enter the data folder and open the root file Edrep.root.

There is also a branch without a Reflector!
